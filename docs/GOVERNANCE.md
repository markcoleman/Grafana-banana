## Governance Structure

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Project Owner
- **Responsible for**: Strategic direction, resource allocation, and final decision authority
- **Accountable to**: Stakeholders and users
- **Current**: [@markcoleman](https://github.com/markcoleman)

#### Technical Lead
- **Responsible for**: Technical architecture decisions, code quality, and technical direction
- **Accountable to**: Project Owner
- **Authority**: Architecture decisions, technology stack, design patterns

#### Security Officer
- **Responsible for**: Security policies, vulnerability management, compliance
- **Accountable to**: Project Owner
- **Authority**: Security standards, access controls, incident response

#### Contributors
- **Responsible for**: Code contributions, documentation, testing
- **Accountable to**: Technical Lead
- **Authority**: Implementation decisions within approved architecture

### Governance Bodies

#### Architecture Review Board (ARB)
- **Purpose**: Review and approve significant architectural decisions
- **Composition**: Technical Lead, Security Officer, senior contributors
- **Meeting Frequency**: As needed for major decisions
- **Decision Process**: Consensus-based with Technical Lead having final authority

#### Security Review Committee
- **Purpose**: Review security incidents, vulnerabilities, and policies
- **Composition**: Security Officer, Technical Lead, Project Owner
- **Meeting Frequency**: Monthly or as needed for incidents
- **Decision Process**: Unanimous for security policies

## Decision-Making Process

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

All significant architectural decisions must be documented using ADRs. See [Architecture Decision Records](./architecture/README.md) for the complete ADR framework.

#### What Requires an ADR?
- Selection of major technologies or frameworks
- Significant changes to system architecture
- Security architecture decisions
- Integration patterns and strategies
- Data storage and management approaches
- Deployment and infrastructure changes

#### ADR Workflow
1. **Proposal**: Create draft ADR documenting context, decision, and consequences
2. **Review**: Share with Architecture Review Board for feedback
3. **Discussion**: Address concerns and incorporate feedback
4. **Decision**: ARB approves or rejects
5. **Implementation**: Upon approval, implement and update ADR status
6. **Documentation**: Link ADR to related code, issues, and PRs

### Standard Operating Procedures

#### Minor Changes
- Code improvements, bug fixes, documentation updates
- Require: Code review by at least one maintainer
- Process: Standard pull request workflow

#### Major Changes
- New features, architectural changes, breaking changes
- Require: ADR, design review, security review
- Process: ADR → Design Review → Implementation → Code Review → Security Review

#### Emergency Changes
- Critical security patches, production incidents
- Require: Immediate action with post-incident review
- Process: Implement → Document → Review within 48 hours

## Architecture Governance

### Technology Standards

#### Approved Technology Stack
- **Backend**: .NET 9+ (LTS versions preferred)
- **Frontend**: Angular 18+ (current major version)
- **Observability**: Grafana Stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Tempo, Loki)
- **Container Runtime**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

#### Technology Selection Criteria
- Long-term support and maintenance
- Community size and activity
- Security track record
- Performance characteristics
- Integration capabilities
- License compatibility (prefer MIT, Apache 2.0)

### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between frontend, backend, and infrastructure
2. **API-First Design**: Well-defined REST APIs with OpenAPI documentation
3. **Security by Design**: Security considerations in every architectural decision
4. **Observability**: Built-in metrics, logging, and tracing
5. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling
6. **Resilience**: Handle failures gracefully
7. **Maintainability**: Clear code, comprehensive documentation

### Architecture Patterns

#### Backend
- Minimal API pattern for endpoints
- Dependency injection for services
- Repository pattern for data access (when applicable)
- CQRS for complex business logic (when applicable)

#### Frontend
- Standalone components
- Service-based architecture
- Reactive programming with RxJS
- State management as needed

## Security Governance

### Security Standards

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for detailed security policies.

#### Key Requirements
- All dependencies must be kept up to date
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed within SLA:
  - Critical: 24 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days
- Secrets must never be committed to repository
- All production traffic must use HTTPS/TLS
- Authentication and authorization required for sensitive operations

### Security Review Process

#### When Required
- New authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Changes to security-sensitive code
- New dependencies from untrusted sources
- Changes to CORS, CSP, or security headers
- Infrastructure changes affecting security posture

#### Review Checklist
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Output encoding/sanitization applied
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Secrets managed securely
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enforced in production

## Data Governance

### Data Classification

## Change Management

### Change Types

#### Standard Changes
- Pre-approved changes following documented procedures
- Low risk, repeatable process
- Examples: Dependency updates, minor bug fixes
- Approval: Automated via CI/CD

#### Normal Changes
- Require assessment and approval
- Medium risk with known impacts
- Examples: New features, significant refactoring
- Approval: Technical Lead or ARB

#### Emergency Changes
- High urgency, typically reactive
- High risk but necessary to prevent/resolve incidents
- Examples: Security patches, critical bug fixes
- Approval: Any senior maintainer, post-implementation review required

### Change Process

1. **Request**: Create issue or ADR describing change
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact, risk, and resources
3. **Approval**: Obtain required approvals based on change type
4. **Planning**: Schedule change, prepare rollback plan
5. **Implementation**: Execute change following procedures
6. **Validation**: Test and verify change
7. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
8. **Review**: Post-implementation review for normal/emergency changes

### Release Management

#### Release Cadence
- Major releases: Quarterly (semantic version X.0.0)
- Minor releases: Monthly (semantic version 0.X.0)
- Patch releases: As needed (semantic version 0.0.X)
- Hotfix releases: Immediate for critical issues

#### Release Process
See [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md) for detailed procedures.

#### Version Control Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Feature development branches
- **hotfix/***: Emergency fixes for production

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment

#### Risk Categories
1. **Technical Risks**: Technology obsolescence, technical debt, scalability
2. **Security Risks**: Vulnerabilities, data breaches, unauthorized access
3. **Operational Risks**: Service disruptions, data loss, performance degradation
4. **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory violations, license issues
5. **Resource Risks**: Key person dependencies, skill gaps

#### Risk Matrix

| Impact / Probability | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|---------------------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| **High**            | Medium | High | Critical | Critical |
| **Medium**          | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Low**             | Low | Low | Medium | High |

#### Risk Response Strategies
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by not pursuing the activity
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Shift risk to third party (insurance, vendor)
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor the risk

### Known Risks
