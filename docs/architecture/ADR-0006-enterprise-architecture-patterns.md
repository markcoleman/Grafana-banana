# ADR-0006: Enterprise Architecture Patterns Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Grafana-banana backend API was initially implemented using a straightforward minimal API approach with business logic embedded directly in endpoint handlers. While this approach is simple and works well for small applications, it has limitations as the application grows:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Business logic was tightly coupled to the API layer
2. **Limited Testability**: Difficult to unit test business logic without running the entire API
3. **Maintenance Challenges**: Changes to business logic required modifying API endpoints
4. **Scalability Issues**: Hard to scale different parts of the application independently
5. **Code Organization**: No clear separation between concerns
6. **Team Productivity**: Difficult for multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously

As the application evolves and potentially adds more complex features (user management, data persistence, integration with external systems), these limitations would become significant technical debt.

### Business Drivers

1. **Enterprise Readiness**: Need for patterns suitable for enterprise-grade applications
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend as requirements evolve
3. **Testability**: Comprehensive testing at all layers
4. **Team Scalability**: Support for larger development teams
5. **Future-Proofing**: Architecture that can evolve with changing requirements

### Technical Drivers

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
2. **Loose Coupling**: Reduce dependencies between components
3. **High Cohesion**: Group related functionality together
4. **SOLID Principles**: Follow industry best practices
5. **Testability**: Enable comprehensive unit and integration testing

## Decision

We will implement enterprise architecture patterns including:

1. **Clean Architecture** with distinct layers:
   - **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and interfaces
   - **Application Layer**: Use cases, queries, handlers
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations
   - **API Layer**: HTTP endpoints and delivery mechanism

2. **CQRS Pattern** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
   - Separate read operations (Queries) from write operations (Commands)
   - Use MediatR library for request/response handling
   - Define queries as immutable records

3. **Repository Pattern**:
   - Define repository interfaces in Domain layer
   - Implement repositories in Infrastructure layer
   - Abstract data access logic from business logic

4. **Mediator Pattern**:
   - Use MediatR for decoupled request handling
   - Handlers implement business logic
   - Enables pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**:
   - Program to interfaces, not implementations
   - High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
   - Both depend on abstractions

### Implementation Details

#### Package Dependencies
- **MediatR 12.4.1**: For CQRS and Mediator pattern implementation
- **FluentValidation 11.10.0**: For future validation pipeline integration

#### Migration Strategy
1. Created new layers without breaking existing functionality
2. Refactored endpoints to use MediatR one at a time
3. Maintained existing Databricks service as infrastructure component
4. Preserved all existing middleware and cross-cutting concerns
5. Kept all observability and security features intact

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to locate and modify code
   - Changes in one layer don't cascade to others

2. **Enhanced Testability**
   - Business logic can be tested in isolation
   - Easy to mock dependencies
   - Repository pattern enables in-memory testing

3. **Better Code Organization**
   - Logical grouping of related functionality
   - Consistent structure across the codebase
   - Easier navigation for developers

4. **Flexibility and Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new features (just add new queries/commands)
   - Can swap implementations without changing business logic
   - Supports future migration to microservices

5. **Team Productivity**
   - Multiple developers can work on different layers simultaneously
   - Reduced merge conflicts
   - Clear contracts between layers
   - Easier onboarding for new team members

6. **Scalability**
   - CQRS enables separate scaling of reads and writes
   - Repository pattern supports caching strategies
   - Clean architecture supports horizontal scaling

7. **Enterprise Alignment**
   - Follows industry best practices
   - Patterns recognized by enterprise development teams
   - Suitable for long-term maintenance

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**
   - More files and classes to manage
   - Additional abstraction layers
   - Learning curve for developers new to these patterns

2. **Initial Development Overhead**
   - More code to write initially
   - Setup and configuration of MediatR
   - Need to create interfaces and implementations

3. **Potential Over-Engineering**
   - For very simple CRUD operations, the pattern might feel heavy
   - Small changes require touching multiple files

4. **Additional Dependencies**
   - MediatR library dependency (12.4.1)
   - FluentValidation library for future use (11.10.0)

### Neutral

1. **Performance**
   - Minimal overhead from MediatR (< 1ms per request)
   - Additional memory for handler instances (negligible)
   - Same performance characteristics as before

2. **Code Volume**
   - More files but better organized
   - Each file is smaller and more focused
   - Overall codebase size slightly increased

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep Minimal API Approach
**Pros**: Simple, less code, easy to understand
**Cons**: Doesn't scale well, tight coupling, hard to test
**Decision**: Rejected - doesn't meet enterprise requirements

### 2. Traditional N-Tier Architecture
**Pros**: Well-understood, simple layering
**Cons**: Often leads to anemic domain models, tight coupling between tiers
**Decision**: Rejected - Clean Architecture provides better separation

### 3. Vertical Slice Architecture
**Pros**: Feature-focused organization, reduced coupling
**Cons**: Can lead to code duplication, harder to enforce cross-cutting concerns
**Decision**: Considered for future - good complement to current approach

### 4. Domain-Driven Design (Full DDD)
**Pros**: Rich domain models, ubiquitous language, bounded contexts
**Cons**: Complex for current application size, steep learning curve
**Decision**: Partially adopted - using entities and repositories, can expand later

### 5. Microservices Architecture
**Pros**: Ultimate scalability, independent deployment
**Cons**: Too complex for current application, operational overhead
**Decision**: Deferred - current architecture supports future migration if needed

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing endpoints continue to work
- Same request/response format
- No breaking changes to API contracts
- Observability features (metrics, tracing, logging) preserved

### Security Considerations
- Security middleware remains unchanged
- Rate limiting still applies to all endpoints
- Input validation can be enhanced with FluentValidation pipeline

### Observability
- All metrics collection continues to work
- Distributed tracing spans created correctly
- Structured logging in handlers
- Health checks unaffected

### Migration Path for New Features

When adding new features:

1. **For Read Operations** (Queries):
   ```csharp
   // 1. Create Query
   public record GetBananaByIdQuery(int Id) : IRequest<BananaAnalytics>;
   
   // 2. Create Handler
   public class GetBananaByIdQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetBananaByIdQuery, BananaAnalytics>
   {
       // Implementation
   }
   
   // 3. Add Endpoint
   app.MapGet("/api/banana/{id}", async (int id, IMediator mediator) =>
       await mediator.Send(new GetBananaByIdQuery(id)));
   ```

2. **For Write Operations** (Commands):
   ```csharp
   // 1. Create Command (with DTO)
   public record CreateBananaCommand(string Region, int ProductionTons) : IRequest<Guid>;
   
   // 2. Create Handler
   public class CreateBananaCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateBananaCommand, Guid>
   {
       // Implementation
   }
   
   // 3. Add Endpoint
   app.MapPost("/api/banana", async (CreateBananaCommand command, IMediator mediator) =>
       await mediator.Send(command));
   ```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Validation Pipeline**
   - Add FluentValidation validators for queries/commands
   - Implement MediatR pipeline behavior for validation
   - Centralize validation logic

2. **Caching Pipeline**
   - Implement caching behavior using MediatR pipeline
   - Cache query results based on attributes
   - Invalidate cache on command execution

3. **Authorization Pipeline**
   - Add authorization behavior to MediatR pipeline
   - Enforce permissions at the use case level
   - Centralize authorization logic

4. **Unit of Work Pattern**
   - Coordinate multiple repository operations
   - Transaction management
   - Atomic operations across entities

5. **Domain Events**
   - Implement domain event publishing
   - Decouple domain logic
   - Enable event-driven architecture
