# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Grafana-banana. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development and evolution of the system.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs provide a historical record of architectural decisions and their rationale.

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Technology Selection**: Choosing frameworks, libraries, or platforms
- **Architectural Patterns**: Implementing specific design patterns or architectural styles
- **Infrastructure**: Decisions about deployment, hosting, or infrastructure
- **Security**: Security architecture and implementation approaches
- **Integration**: How systems or components interact
- **Data Management**: Data storage, processing, or governance approaches
- **Performance**: Strategies for optimization or scalability
- **Breaking Changes**: Changes that affect existing contracts or behaviors

## ADR Template

Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

### Positive
- What becomes easier or better?

### Negative
- What becomes harder or worse?

### Neutral
- What else is affected?

## Implementation

### Timeline
- When will this be implemented?

### Owner
- Who is responsible for implementation?

### Dependencies
- What needs to be in place first?

## Alternatives Considered

What other approaches did we consider?

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- Description
- Pros
- Cons
- Why rejected

## References

- Related ADRs
- External documentation
- GitHub issues or PRs

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Created** | YYYY-MM-DD |
| **Updated** | YYYY-MM-DD |
| **Author** | @username |
| **Reviewers** | @username, @username |
| **Status** | [Current Status] |
```

## ADR Naming Convention

ADRs should be named using the following format:

```
ADR-XXXX-short-descriptive-title.md
```

Where:
- `XXXX` is a zero-padded sequential number (e.g., 0001, 0002, 0010, 0042)
- `short-descriptive-title` is a brief, kebab-case description

Examples:
- `ADR-0001-use-angular-for-frontend.md`
- `ADR-0002-implement-opentelemetry-observability.md`
- `ADR-0003-adopt-minimal-api-pattern.md`

## ADR Process

### 1. Proposal Stage

1. Create a new ADR file using the template
2. Set status to "Proposed"
3. Fill in Context, Decision, and Consequences sections
4. Create a Pull Request with the ADR

### 2. Review Stage

1. Share ADR with Architecture Review Board
2. Gather feedback and update ADR
3. Address concerns and alternatives
4. Iterate until consensus is reached

### 3. Decision Stage

1. Architecture Review Board approves or rejects
2. If approved, update status to "Accepted"
3. If rejected, update status and document reasons
4. Merge the ADR

### 4. Implementation Stage

1. Implement the decision
2. Link implementation PRs to the ADR
3. Update ADR if implementation reveals new information
4. Mark ADR as implemented when complete

### 5. Evolution Stage

ADRs can be:
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (link to new ADR)
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable (document why)
- **Updated**: Modified based on new information (maintain version history)

## Resources

### ADR Best Practices
- Keep ADRs concise but complete
- Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
- Document alternatives considered
- Update ADRs as they evolve
- Link related ADRs
