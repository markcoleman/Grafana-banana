# Next Steps After Merging This PR

This document outlines what to do after merging this PR to ensure the CI/CD pipeline works correctly.

## Immediate Actions After Merge

### 1. Verify Automatic Release Workflow

Once you merge this PR to `main`, the `publish-release.yml` workflow will trigger automatically.

**What to watch:**
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Find the "Publish Release on Push to Main" workflow
3. Monitor the three jobs:
   - Determine Next Version
   - Build and Push Docker Images
   - Create GitHub Release

**Expected outcome:**
- A new release (likely v0.1.0 or v0.0.1 depending on commits)
- Docker containers published to GHCR
- GitHub release created with changelog

### 2. Make Container Packages Public (if needed)

By default, GitHub packages are private. To make them public:

1. Go to: https://github.com/markcoleman/Grafana-banana/packages
2. Click on each package (backend and frontend)
3. Go to Package Settings (bottom right)
4. Under "Danger Zone" â†’ "Change package visibility"
5. Change to "Public"
6. Confirm the change

This allows anyone to pull your containers without authentication.

### 3. Test Pulling Containers

After the workflow completes and packages are public:

```bash
# Pull the containers
docker pull ghcr.io/markcoleman/grafana-banana/backend:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/markcoleman/grafana-banana/frontend:latest

# Test running them
docker run -d -p 5000:8080 \
  -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development \
  ghcr.io/markcoleman/grafana-banana/backend:latest

docker run -d -p 4200:80 \
  ghcr.io/markcoleman/grafana-banana/frontend:latest

# Verify they're running
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:4200

# Clean up
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

### 4. Test Using Docker Compose with GHCR

```bash
# Update docker-compose.ghcr.yml to use the new version
# Then run:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml ps

# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml logs -f

# Clean up
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml down
```

## Testing the Workflows

### Test Container Build on PR

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b test/container-build`
2. Make a small change (e.g., update README)
3. Push and create a PR
4. Check that `test-containers.yml` runs
5. Review the test summary in the PR checks

### Test Manual Release

1. Go to Actions â†’ "Manual Release and Publish Containers"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter a version like `v0.2.0`
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Verify containers are built and pushed

### Test Semantic Versioning

Make commits with different conventional commit formats and see the version bumps:

```bash
# Patch bump
git commit -m "fix: correct button alignment"
# Merge to main â†’ should bump patch version

# Minor bump
git commit -m "feat: add user settings page"
# Merge to main â†’ should bump minor version

# Major bump
git commit -m "feat!: redesign authentication flow"
# Merge to main â†’ should bump major version
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails with Permission Error

**Problem:** "Resource not accessible by integration" error

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
2. Under "Workflow permissions"
3. Select "Read and write permissions"
4. Save

### Containers Not Visible

**Problem:** Can't find containers in GHCR

**Solution:**
1. Check the workflow completed successfully
2. Go to Packages section in GitHub
3. Verify packages are public
4. Check package names match `ghcr.io/markcoleman/grafana-banana/backend`

### Version Not Incrementing

**Problem:** Version stays the same or unexpected

**Solution:**
1. Check commit messages follow conventional commits format
2. Use `fix:`, `feat:`, `feat!:` prefixes
3. Check workflow logs for version calculation
4. Manually test version logic: `bash .github/workflows/test-semver.sh`

### Release Not Created

**Problem:** Containers pushed but no GitHub release

**Solution:**
1. Check workflow logs for "Create Release" step
2. Verify `contents: write` permission is set
3. Check if tag already exists: `git tag`
4. If tag exists, delete it: `git push --delete origin v1.0.0`

## Regular Maintenance

### Monitor Workflow Runs

Regularly check:
- Actions tab for failed workflows
- Container registry for disk usage
- Release notes for accuracy

### Keep Dependencies Updated

Update workflow actions periodically:
```yaml
actions/checkout@v5           # Check for v6
docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 # Check for v4
docker/build-push-action@v5   # Check for v6
```

### Review and Clean Old Containers

GHCR has storage limits. Periodically:
1. Go to Packages
2. Review old versions
3. Delete unused versions
4. Keep only recent and major versions

## Optimization Ideas

After everything works, consider:

1. **Add caching for faster builds:**
   - Already uses Docker layer caching
   - Consider adding dependency caching

2. **Add release notes template:**
   - Create `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Customize release notes format

3. **Add environment-specific builds:**
   - Add `staging` builds for pre-production
   - Use different tags for different environments

4. **Add security scanning:**
   - Integrate Trivy for container scanning
   - Add SARIF upload for security results

5. **Add build notifications:**
   - Slack notifications for releases
   - Email notifications for failures

## Documentation Updates

After confirming everything works:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new CI/CD features
2. Add release badge to README:
   ```markdown
   ![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/markcoleman/Grafana-banana)
   ```
3. Update `QUICKSTART.md` with container usage
4. Add examples to documentation

## Success Criteria

âœ… The setup is successful when:
- [ ] Automatic release workflow runs on push to main
- [ ] Containers are published to GHCR
- [ ] GitHub releases are created with correct versions
- [ ] Containers can be pulled publicly
- [ ] docker-compose.ghcr.yml works with published containers
- [ ] Container tests run on PRs
- [ ] Manual release workflow works
- [ ] Semantic versioning increments correctly

## Support

If you encounter issues not covered here:
1. Check workflow logs in Actions tab
2. Review `docs/CI_CD_WORKFLOWS.md` for detailed documentation
3. Check GitHub Actions documentation
4. Review conventional commits specification
5. Test locally with Docker build commands

## Summary

The CI/CD pipeline is now set up to:
- âœ… Automatically version and release on push to main
- âœ… Build and publish Docker containers
- âœ… Test containers on PRs
- âœ… Support manual releases when needed
- âœ… Follow semantic versioning best practices

Just merge this PR and watch the magic happen! ðŸš€
