# CI/CD Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This PR implements a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the Grafana-banana project with the following capabilities:

### 1. Automatic Releases on Push to Main ✅
**File:** `.github/workflows/publish-release.yml`

When code is merged to the `main` branch, this workflow automatically:
- Analyzes git commit history to determine the next semantic version
- Builds Docker containers for both backend and frontend
- Pushes containers to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Creates a GitHub release with:
  - Automatically generated version tag
  - Changelog based on commits
  - Docker pull commands
  - Multi-platform support (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

**Semantic Versioning:**
- Uses conventional commits to determine version bumps
- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes (commits with `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`)
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features (commits starting with `feat:`)
- **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes and other changes

### 2. Container Build Testing on PRs ✅
**File:** `.github/workflows/test-containers.yml`

For every pull request to `main` or `develop`:
- Builds Docker images (without pushing)
- Validates containers start correctly
- Runs smoke tests on both backend and frontend
- Provides test summary in PR checks
- Uses GitHub Actions cache for faster builds

This ensures container builds work before merging to main.

### 3. Manual Release Support ✅
**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` (updated)

Enhanced the existing manual release workflow with:
- Clear documentation of its purpose
- Support for manual version specification
- Can be triggered via GitHub Actions UI
- Useful for hotfixes or special releases

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation ✅
**Files:** 
- `docs/CI_CD_WORKFLOWS.md` - Complete workflow documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with CI/CD section
- `.github/workflows/test-semver.sh` - Test script for semver logic

## How It Works

### For Developers

1. **Work on a feature:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Create PR:**
   - CI builds and tests run automatically
   - Container build tests validate Docker images
   - Review checks before merging

3. **Merge to main:**
   - Automatic release workflow triggers
   - Version is determined from commits
   - Containers are published
   - GitHub release is created

### Version Examples

```bash
# Current version: v1.2.3

# Patch bump → v1.2.4
git commit -m "fix: correct validation bug"

# Minor bump → v1.3.0
git commit -m "feat: add user dashboard"

# Major bump → v2.0.0
git commit -m "feat!: redesign authentication"
# or
git commit -m "feat: new auth

BREAKING CHANGE: requires OAuth"
```

## Testing

### What Was Tested

1. **YAML Syntax Validation:** ✅
   - All workflow files validated with Python YAML parser
   - No syntax errors

2. **Semantic Versioning Logic:** ✅
   - Created test script: `.github/workflows/test-semver.sh`
   - Tested all version bump scenarios:
     - Initial version (v0.1.0)
     - Patch bumps
     - Minor bumps (new features)
     - Major bumps (breaking changes with !)
     - Major bumps (with BREAKING CHANGE footer)
   - All tests pass

3. **Workflow Structure:** ✅
   - Proper job dependencies
   - Correct permissions (contents: write, packages: write)
   - Modern actions used (deprecated actions replaced)

### What Needs Testing in GitHub

The workflows need to be tested in the actual GitHub environment:
1. Test the container build workflow on a PR
2. Test the automatic release on push to main
3. Verify containers are published to GHCR correctly
4. Verify GitHub releases are created correctly

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `.github/workflows/publish-release.yml` - Automatic release workflow
- `.github/workflows/test-containers.yml` - Container testing workflow
- `.github/workflows/test-semver.sh` - Semantic version test script
- `docs/CI_CD_WORKFLOWS.md` - Comprehensive CI/CD documentation

### Modified Files
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Added documentation comments
- `README.md` - Updated CI/CD section with new workflows

## Security Considerations

- Uses GitHub-provided tokens (no secrets needed)
- Container images built on GitHub runners
- Multi-platform builds for better security coverage
- All workflows follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Proper permission scoping (contents: write, packages: write)

## Next Steps

After merging this PR:

1. **Test on first merge to main:**
   - Watch the `publish-release.yml` workflow run
   - Verify version is correctly determined
   - Check containers are published to GHCR
   - Verify GitHub release is created

2. **Test container access:**
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/markcoleman/grafana-banana/backend:latest
   docker pull ghcr.io/markcoleman/grafana-banana/frontend:latest
   ```

3. **Make packages public** (if not already):
   - Go to package settings in GitHub
   - Change visibility to public

## Benefits

✅ **Automated Releases:** No manual version tagging needed
✅ **Semantic Versioning:** Automatic version management
✅ **Container Publishing:** Automatic push to GHCR
✅ **Pre-merge Testing:** Validate containers before merge
✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive guide for developers
✅ **Flexibility:** Both automatic and manual workflows
✅ **Developer Friendly:** Simple conventional commit format

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can:
1. Disable the workflows temporarily via GitHub UI
2. Use the manual release workflow for specific versions
3. Build and push containers manually if needed

The workflows don't modify the repository code, only create releases and push containers, so there's minimal risk.
